# Machine Failure Prediction Model

Machine Failure Prediction Model is a solution that leverages machine learning to predict potential failures in machines. Utilising the power of `scikit-learn` and data analytics, this model can assist industries and organisations in anticipating machinery breakdowns and taking preventive measures.
